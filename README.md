Hi, my name is Marcel Innocentini. I'm an agronomist focused on data analysis applications on agriculture and agribusiness. 
My goal is always trying to apply data-driven concepts in farms, agricultural ventures, and over all the products and business chains related to it. 
The complete projects that I develop as agronomist and data analyst you'll find here in my GitHub profile.
You can also reach me on LinkedIn, where I share some partials results about my job, projects that I'm involved, and much more.
